**COURSE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM**

**Project Overview**

The Course Recommendation System is designed to suggest relevant courses to users based on their interests and behaviors.
The system employs two primary approaches: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This project is ideal for educational platforms seeking to enhance user experience by providing personalized course recommendations.

**Features**

**Content-Based Filtering:**

Analyzes course descriptions and metadata to recommend similar courses based on user preferences.

**Collaborative Filtering:**

Uses KNN to identify users with similar interaction patterns and recommend courses based on these similarities.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

Provides insights into the dataset through visualizations, including heatmaps for user-course interactions and feature correlations.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

Assesses the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like precision, recall, and sparsity.

**Limitations**

**Sparsity:**

Collaborative filtering suffered from 
sparse user-course interaction data, reducing 
recommendation accuracy for users with limited 
history. 

**Scalability:**

The computational cost of KNN increased with larger datasets, indicating a need 
for optimization in large-scale implementations

**Future Work**:

This project provides a strong 
foundation for developing an effective course 
recommendation system using content-based and 
collaborative filtering techniques. However, 
there are opportunities for significant 
improvements and expansions. The primary 
focus of future work will be to explore hybrid 
approaches 

**Conclusion:**

This project successfully implemented a 
course recommendation system using 
content-based filtering and 
collaborative filtering with K-Nearest 
Neighbors (KNN). The content-based 
model provided personalized 
recommendations by analyzing course 
descriptions, while the collaborative 
filtering model leveraged user 
interaction data to identify patterns in 
user preferences. Both approaches 
demonstrated their strengths, with the 
content-based system excelling for new 
users and the collaborative system 
performing well with sufficient 
interaction data.
